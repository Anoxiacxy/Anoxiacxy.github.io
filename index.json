I am going to use the online 6809 assembler. And try to write programs as below.\nCount From 0 To 9 # Write a program that prints the digits from 0 to 9, one after another, in the top left of the text screen. That is, it prints a 0 in the top left, then it replaces the 0 with a 1, then it replaces the 1 with a 2, and so on until it has printed 9. It should return to the operating system (with an RTS) at the end of the program.\nTo get the extra marks, your program must be 8 or fewer instructions in length.\nSingle Digit Fibonacci # Write a program to compute and print each of the first 7 Fibonacci numbers. It must compute the numbers in the sequence. It must print each, one after the other, in the top left of the text screen in the emulator. The first 7 numbers in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. These are all single digit numbers.\nExtend your program to print the numbers one after the other on the top row of the text screen. That is, the top left corner of the screen should read \u0026ldquo;0112358\u0026rdquo; once your program has finished running.\nHexadecimal Fibonacci # Write a routine that, given a value in register D, will print the value in hexadecimal. It should print green on a black background. Hint: The emulator screen does not use ASCII, character 1 is \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo;, character 2 is \u0026lsquo;B\u0026rsquo;, and so on. For this you might find it useful to write a routine that given a character in register A, will print it to the screen. With these routines, write a short test program to print the value FDBC then a space then 1234. The top left of the screen should read \u0026ldquo;FDBC 1234\u0026rdquo; once you have completed this.\nWrite a program that prints a comma seperated list of the first 25 Fibonacci numbers in hexadecimal. You must compute the sequence. Once your program has return the text screen should look like this:\n","date":"10 July 2023","permalink":"/projects/6809-assembly/","section":"Projects","summary":"What is 6089? # Well, the last time I was confused like this was when I seen the number 6502.

","title":"Projects"},{"content":" Practice 1 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Decisions made by a group are always better than decisions made by individuals.\nI agree with the statement that group decisions are better.\nFor one thing, group decisions are more likely to be applicable. When a decision is concluded by many peoples, more factors and consequences are to be taken in to considerations because different people have different view of aspect. Usually, it leads to a more comprehensive decision.\nFor another, members will be more motivated to implement the decision. A person feels more responsible if his or her suggestion accounts for the final decision, just because of the feeling that being acknowledged by others. Therefore, he or she is more likely to work hard to make the decision work. Group decision means everyone in the group will have this kind of thought less or more, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s better than only one person that pushes everyone to work.\nPractice 2 When people are working, some prefer to do hard work first and then do easy work, while others want to do the easy work first and then do the hard one. Which way do you prefer?\nI prefer to do the easy work first.\nBecause I think positive feedback are important at first. Easy work is more likely to be done quickly and successfully, which will give me a sense of achievement. While if I do the hard work first, maybe I have no idea how to do it, feel frustrated and even give up.\nBesides, thinking twice before doing hard work is more efficiency. Complex work usually requires more experience and planning, you may encounter many troubles during the process and stuck in them. This will waste a lot of time. But with the knowledge or just some inspiration from the easy work you have done before, those troubles in the hard work can be solved more easily.\nPractice 3 When it comes to buying daily necessities, some people prefer to shop in grocery stores now and then to gather all the things they need, while others prefer to go to a supermarket and buy everything all at once. Which do you prefer and why?\nI prefer to prepare all the things I need in a supermarket.\nFor one thing, it can save a lot of time. Compared to a supermarket, grocery stores are relatively small, they don\u0026rsquo;t have a wide range of products, and distribute in different places. Since I can buy all kinds of daily necessities in a supermarket, the time I otherwise spend on going to different grocery stores can be saved.\nFor another, it helps to develop a good habit of planning. When going to a supermarket, I need to think for a while about what I need and whether I spend too much money on something. This habit can help me to make better use of my money and avoid impulse buying.\nPractice 4 To enrich their after-school lives and cover living expenses, many college students tend to seek part-time jobs. Some universities worry that work might cut into students\u0026rsquo; study time. Therefore, they set a limit on the numbers of hours per week that students spend on part-time jobs. Do you think this is a good idea?\nI think it is a good idea. Part-time jobs should be limited for college students.\nFor one thing, not all students can handle the balance between study and part-time jobs. The main purpose of going to college is to study. And the part-time jobs are just some approaches to enrich or support study life. It is thoughtless if students spend too much time on part-time jobs and ignore their study. However, these students always exist. So the limit on the part-time jobs is necessary.\nBesides, study needs the atmosphere of campus. If most students are pursuing part-time jobs, the campus will be less active in academic activities. Students will be less motivated to study. As a consequence, the quality of education will be affected.\nPractice 5 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Schools should require students to complete physical fitness tests before graduation?\nI agree with the statement. Physical fitness tests are necessary for students.\nI think it is an opportunity for students to have a physical education class. As we know, classroom-based classes usually have a final exam. Students will be forced to study hard to pass the exam. However, these can be used as an excuse for other teachers to occupy the physical education class time. Physical education teachers are prone to getting sick easily.\nIf students are required to complete physical fitness tests, the physical education class will exist. Teachers have no reason to occupy their physical class, and students themselves will value physical exercise more. A balanced life between study and exercise, I believe, is good for students\u0026rsquo; health.\nPractice 6 When people travel, some people prefer to visit some new places where they have never been before. Others prefer to return to places that they have already visited. Which way do you prefer? Explain why.\nI prefer to visit some new places where I have never seen before.\nFor one thing, new places can bring me new experiences. I can taste unique local food, appreciate different scenery and expose to new culture. These experiences enrich my life and broaden my horizon.\nFor another, on workdays, I have already bored with everything around me. Going to the same place again still makes me feel bored, even reminds me of the boring work. Travel is not a regular thing for me, so I want to make the most of it. To escape from the boring life, I prefer to go to a new place when I have time to travel, where I can forget all the troubles from work and enjoy the feeling of freshness.\nPractice 7 Some students prefer to make friends with people who are about the same age. Other students prefer to make friends with people of different ages. Which way do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.\nI prefer to make friends with people about the same age.\nBecause making friends with people about the same age is easier. One generation have their own experience, so it is less likely to have the common topics between people of different ages. We know, topics is important for people to communicate with each other, and common topics make people feel closer. So the people of the same age are more likely to become friends.\nBesides, people of different ages have different life stages. For example, as a teenager, I can\u0026rsquo;t play basketball with people who are in my parents\u0026rsquo; age because they are not as energetic as me. And I can\u0026rsquo;t play computer games with children because they are not allowed to play games. It seems that even though we are friends, we can\u0026rsquo;t do many things together.\n","date":"10 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/speaking-written-responses-1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Practice 1 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

Some people perfer to travel alone. Which do you prefer?\nI perfer to travel alone.\nFor one thing, the schedule for the trip will be more flexible. When I travel by my self, it is more likely for me to choose when to go to the destination and when to leave.\nFor another, it allows me to choose the tourist attactions that I show interest in. While traveling with families, it is possible that we cannot reach an agreement about where to visit while it is possible for me to go to the places which I like.\nPreference 2 There are two places to choose. One is the place that you have never visited with higher price. One is the place that you have visited before with lower price. Which one do you choose?\nI choose to go to the place which I have never visited with higher price.\nFor one thing, higher price brings better experiences. Higher price means superior service, extravagant accomodation and maganificent landscapes, which allows me to enjoy myself in a more comfortable way.\nFor another, there is a lack of freshness in the places that I have visited before. By contrast, the new place always enriches our life experience by providing a chance for me to taste unique local food, appreciate different scenery and expose to new culture.\nPreference 3 There are two universites. One is prestigious but requires high tuition. One is not famous but offers scholarship. Which one do you choose?\nI prefer to choose the prestigious university which requires high tuition.\nFor one thing, it offers resources such as professional teachers, advanced science lab and modern library with abundant books, which allows me to achieve better academic performances.\nFor another, even though it requires high tuition, I can do some part-time johs such as working as teaching assistant in campus to cover part of the tuition.\nShould 1 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents should decide career for their children.\nI disagree with the statement that parents should decide career for their children.\nFor one thing, the carreer might not be suitable for the children. It is likely that parents choose the career which is the best in their eyes without considering their children\u0026rsquo; interests and expectations. As a consequence, their children refuse to devote themselves to the career.\nFor another, it keeps their children from becoming independent. When parents decide career for their children, their kids will gradually rely on their parents. As a consequence, they tend to count on others whenever possible.\nShould 2 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? We should consult our parents when making decisions.\nI agree with the statement that we should consult our parents when making decisions.\nFor one thing, they can instruct us to make informed choices. Parents, who are more experienced, will take all possible factors into account and offer more feasible advices to help us to avoid making unnecessary mistakes.\nFor another, they can offer support for us such as mental support and financial support. For instance, when we plan to start a new business and need some money, our parents could provide good financial basis for us.\nShould 3 Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Companies should allow employees to listen to music while working.\nI disagree with the statement that companies should allow employees to listen to music while working.\nFor one thing, it leads to lower working efficiency. Listening to music will distract employees\u0026rsquo; attention from what employees are focusing on. As a consequence, they are less able to accomplish our tasks on time.\nFor another, it has negative influence on the communication with others. When customers, colleagues and superiors try to start a conversation, the employees who are putting on their earphones will fail to respond to them promptly.\nComparison 1 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life now is better than before.\nI agree with the statement that life now is better than before.\nFor one thing, the transportation system is more complete. Different means of transportations are available such as subway, airplane and train, which takes less time for people to travel around.\nFor anther, the telecommunication tools are more advanced. Thanks to the advent of cell phone, it is posible for us to connect with others within several seconds when something urgent takes place.\nComparison 2 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is easier to be children than to be adults.\nI agree with the statement.\nFor one thing, children do not to be concerned about making money while it is necessary for adults to work hard and support their family, which is a heavy burden for them.\nFor another, children do not need to bother themselves about taking care of other family members while while adults are supposed to attend to all of the members in the family.\n","date":"7 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/speaking-recitation/","section":"Posts","summary":"Preference 1 Some people perfer to travel with their family.

However, all the problems raised in the reading passage can be solved according to the listening materials. Indeed, we can build a residential station that is floating about 50 kilometers\u0026rsquo; height.\nFirst, the extreme pressure is the biggest problem if someone wants to set a human presence at Venus\u0026rsquo; surface. However, as is proposed by the proferssor, the pressure about 50 kilometers from the surface approximately equals to what on the Earth. That is because the pressure will decrease when the height is increasing. Therefore, it is unnecessary to overcome those techniques to extreme pressure.\nSecond, the reading passage contends that the water, oxygen, and those who are fundamentals to human hardly exist on Venus and need to to transfer from Earth. In contrast, the professor argues that by collecting carbon dioxide and other resources, we can produce enough water and oxygen with some chemical procedures. That will save a lot and make it possible for living a long time.\nThird, by the reading passage, Venus is covered by thick clouds, very little sunlight reaches its surface and solar power cells are useless. While, the professor says, this problem still can be solved. When setting a station around 50 km, the clouds are not that thick, we can collect the direct sunlight from above and the reflected sunlight from below. So, there is sufficient energy to power the floating station.\nTPO28 52:48\nThe reading passage proposed three arguments that strong support for the truth that Peary have reached the pole on April 7, 1909. However, the listening materials believe those arguments are not solid and convincing, and offers relevant explanations to disprove them individually.\nFirst, though there is a committee investigating Peary\u0026rsquo;s records and equipment according to the reading passage. It is ture but the professor doubts they are not objective. Most members of the committee are Pearcy\u0026rsquo;s friends, they may support money to this challenge as fundation. Still the invesigation only last for two days, which could involve bias to the result.\nSecond, the reading passage raises a experiment that Tom reached the North Pole less than 37 days setting out from Ellesmere Island, which argues against Skeptics\u0026rsquo; arguement that Peary cannot travel that fast and is unable to reach within 37 days. But the situation has taken another turn. The professor states that Tom \u0026rsquo;s travel and Peary\u0026rsquo;s travel are different. Tom didn\u0026rsquo;t take food, and there was an airplane fly along with him, which meant Tom was traveling under external favor while Peary was unfavorable. So, the duration of Tom\u0026rsquo;s travel within 37 days cannot proves that Peary could do it as well.\nThird, the passage says there are some photographs can support Pearcy reached the North Pole, just by the cohererant of speculated time with Sun\u0026rsquo;s position. In contrast, the professor claims this method is inaccuracy, because the technique requires precise photographs, while those provided photographs are blurred and faded. Therefore, it is still unable to determine whether Peary\u0026rsquo;s North Pole travel is really taken.\nTPO49\nTPO16\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/posts/writing/0712/","section":"Posts","summary":"TPO40 33:15\nThe reading passage states that the environments of Venus are so extreme that it is impossible to maintain a human presence there.
